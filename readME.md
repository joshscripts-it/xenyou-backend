# XENYOU PROJECT

## ðŸ”‘ Operations flow

- Student types a query (structured or natural language) into the Frontend UI.

- Query goes to FastAPI Gateway â†’ routes to Search & Recommendation service.

- If natural language, NLP Parser (OpenAI/HuggingFace) converts it â†’ filters.

- Filters + embeddings go into pgvector/FAISS for semantic matching.

- Results re-ranked with CF recommender (based on student history).

- Ranked hostel list returned â†’ frontend shows cards + chat-style response.

- All interactions (clicks, saves, bookings) logged in Analytics Service.

- Periodic jobs (Celery) retrain models â†’ updated recommender served via API.

## SCALFFOLDING

Python project scaffold for XenYou (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + pgvector-ready + embeddings demo).

This will give you:

âœ… FastAPI backend (/search endpoint)

âœ… SQLModel ORM + Postgres connection

âœ… Embedding generator (sentence-transformers)

âœ… FAISS in-memory index (easy to swap later for pgvector/Pinecone)

âœ… Simple project structure ready for expansion

## Start API
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

## ðŸ”§ Setup pgvector

embeddings are stored and queried directly inside PostgreSQL with pgvector instead of FAISS.This makes the system persistent and production-ready.
### ðŸ”‘ Why pgvector > FAISS here

âœ… Persistent in DB (no need to rebuild index on restart)

âœ… Works with SQL joins + filters (budget, distance) in one query

âœ… Easy to scale (just add embeddings column & index)

## Interaction Logging Service
 â†’ Track what students do (click, save, apply).

## Recommender Service (LightFM stub) 
 â†’ Train a hybrid (content + collaborative filtering) model. Run as background training job for now.

## Background Task Setup
FastAPI BackgroundTasks (for lightweight jobs). To be later scaled up with Celery + Redis if needed.
### Celery + Redis
For More Control (Celery + Redis)
For production scale:

- Use Celery Beat (scheduler) + Redis or RabbitMQ.

- This gives you retry, monitoring, distributed workers.

    Example: run training every midnight UTC automatically.

#### ðŸš€ Workflow Now

- Add students + hostels.

- Students interact (click/save/apply).

- Recommender auto-trains daily in the background.

- Students get fresh, personalized hostel recommendations.
